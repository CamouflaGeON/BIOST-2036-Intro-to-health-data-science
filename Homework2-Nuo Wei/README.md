# homework 2: visualization

Please use Firearm Death Data from 2016 to make a figure or figures to show 
the relation between Gun Law Strictness and firearm deaths in USA. 

# Requirment

* Use read_excel() to read `FirearmDeath2016.xlsx`. The data dictionary is on the second page of the excel file.
 
* Clearly show and explain the components that you are adding step by step starting with base figure `p0`.

* Use the knowledge of ggplot2 visualization to make the figure (figures) as complete as possible including title, legends, axes, labels etc. All texts should be meaningful and understandable. 

* At the end of your homework, please show a standalone R code chunk (not with `p0`), so I can run this chunk from RStudio directly. Please add a figure caption with `fig.cap=` in this final R code chunk.

* Make sure the final output is a clean document using R markdown.

# Grading

Grade will be based on the final figure(s) and the qualiy of the document.

I will pick several best figures and R code chunk. The purpose of this process is "learning from the best".
