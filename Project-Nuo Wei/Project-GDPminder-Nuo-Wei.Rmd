# Introduction & Objections 

The general information of every country plays a very important role in analyzing the average situations of every country and exploring what variables may affect each other in the especially continent or country in order to improve global public health. Gapminder(https://www.gapminder.org/data/) is an independent educational non-proﬁt ﬁghting global misconceptions. In addition, the data from WHO, World Bank, and United Nations to make sure that all sources are reliable and valuable. 

We have used data from Gapminder. But it needs to be completed. In this project, I will extend what we did in homework 3, and study life expectancy, population, income, child mortality, CO2 emission per person, and Babies per woman in order to explore the relationship between those values with continents or regions. 

There are some questions I aim to in this project. 

1. Changes in the number of countries in each region over time
2. Changes in the value of gdpminder over time
3. The distribution values of gdpminder in each region. 
4. The correlation coefficient of gdpminder 
5. The variables may make influence the baby per woman.



# Data import & Clean 

## Importing Dataset from file

In this step, importing and read downloaded csv files from Gapminder website.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#life expectancy, population, income, child mortality, CO2 emission per person and Babies per woman

life_ex <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/life_expectancy_years.csv")

popu <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/population_total.csv")

income <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted.csv")

child_mortality <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born.csv")

CO2 <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/co2_emissions_tonnes_per_person.csv")

baby <- read_csv("D:/University of Pittsburgh/BIOST 2036 Intro to health data science/Project-Nuo Wei/children_per_woman_total_fertility.csv")
```

## Unit function 

From those downloaded CSV files, I noticed that there are units such as “K”, “M”, and “B” in those datasets such as population and income. For researching the next step, I should convert those units into a number. I wrote a function like this.

```{r}
func <- function(x) {
  for(i in 1:NROW(x)) 
    x[i] <- eval(parse(text=str_replace_all(x[i], c("k" = "*1000", 
                                                        "M" = "*1000000",
                                                        "B" = "*1000000000"
                                                        ))))
  x
}

```

There is an example that can make sure this function working well. 

```{r}
DF <- data.frame(country = c("A", "B"),
                 `1799` = c("8.1M", "3k"),
                 `1800` = c("2400", "75M"),
                 `1801` = c("6.04k", "23"),check.names = FALSE)
DF

DF1 <- DF %>% mutate(across(.cols = -country, 
                          .fns = ~func(.x)))
DF1
```

Applying this function to the variables population and income which containing those numerical units I was confused.

```{r}
popu <- popu %>% mutate(across(.cols = -country, 
                          .fns = ~func(.x)))
popu

income <- income %>% mutate(across(.cols = -country, 
                          .fns = ~func(.x)))
income

```




# Merging with Years and regions of gdpminder

## Selecting data columns from 1960 to 2020

Using `pivot_longer` to clear data, and letting population and income be numeric. 

```{r}
life_ex_tidy <- life_ex %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2020"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2020")), names_to = "year", values_to = "life_expectancy")


popu_tidy <- popu %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2020"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2020")), names_to = "year", values_to = "population") %>%
  mutate(population=as.numeric(population))


income_tidy <- income %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2020"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2020")), names_to = "year", values_to = "income") %>%
  mutate(income = as.numeric(income))

child_mortality_tidy <- child_mortality %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2020"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2020")), names_to = "year", values_to = "child_mortality")


CO2_tidy <- CO2 %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2017"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2017")), names_to = "year", values_to = "CO2")


baby_tidy <- baby %>% select(country,c(as.character("1960":"2020"))) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(as.character("1960":"2020")), names_to = "year", values_to = "baby")

```

And, combing multiple CSV files from 1960 to 2020.

Using `lefe_jion` to combine those information together by country and year.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
Study <- left_join(life_ex_tidy, popu_tidy)
Study <- left_join(Study, income_tidy)
Study <- left_join(Study, child_mortality_tidy)
Study <- left_join(Study, CO2_tidy)
Study <- left_join(Study, baby_tidy)
Study <- drop_na(Study)
Study

```


## Location of world

I used the information on regions and continents from `dslabs` package as in our course.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
data(gapminder)
#colnames(gapminder)

gapminder[1:10,]
```

## Removing Duplicates and NA 

From `dslabs` package, I select the continent and region for each country and convert those variables into characters. However, there is some duplicated information such as one row of detailed situations of a country repeated a number of times. In this case, I should keep only one I need and remove all `NA` values. 

```{r,message=FALSE}
place <- gapminder%>% select(country, continent, region)%>%
  mutate(country = as.character(country)) %>%
  mutate(continent = as.character(continent)) %>%
  mutate(region = as.character(region)) %>%
  distinct() %>% drop_na()

place[1:10,]
```

## Merging with information and region

Using `lefe_jion` to combine gdpminder information and region together by country and year.

```{r}
Study1 <- left_join(Study, place, by = "country") 
Study1 <- Study1 %>% drop_na()

Study1[1:10,]
```








# Association between data and region

## Summarizing data

For the following, I will find the associations between continents or regions with gdpmnder .

Firstly, I should summarize that information and categorize it by years and continents, and regions, in this case, I want to find the general situations of each continent in especially year, so I choose the average all gdpminder values by the number of countries in every year.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grp_gap_data <- 
  Study1 %>% 
    group_by(year, continent) %>% 
    summarize(
      count = n(),
      ave_life   = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_popu   = mean(population, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_income   = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_child_mortality = mean(child_mortality, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_CO2   = mean(CO2, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_baby   = mean(baby, na.rm = TRUE),
    )
grp_gap_data
```

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grp_gap_data1 <- 
  Study1 %>% 
    group_by(year, region) %>% 
    summarize(
      count = n(),
      ave_life   = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_popu   = mean(population, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_income   = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_child_mortality = mean(child_mortality, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_CO2   = mean(CO2, na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_baby   = mean(baby, na.rm = TRUE),
    )


grp_gap_data1
```

There, I get two nice tidy data of averaged gdpminder values for each continent by year and do the same thing to regions. 


## Number of country and years 

There are linear relationships between years and the number of countries in continents or regions.

```{r,fig.height=5, fig.width=10}

grp_gap_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))+xlab("Year") + ylab("Number of countries in continents") +
      theme_bw()

  


grp_gap_data1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(color=region, group=region)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=count)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))+xlab("Year") + ylab("Number of countries in regions") +
      theme_bw()


```

From the plots, I can observe that the number of countries was increasing with the development of time, especially before the 21st century. For some relatively new countries, the information about general is missing due to historical reasons such as Ukraine and some located in Africa or Oceania. From the 1950s to 2000, the world landscape was very turbulent, with many countries seeking independence from colonies evident in Africa and Asia, and the collapse of the Soviet Union leading to the emergence of more European countries.


## Gdpminder values and years 

There are linear relationships between years and several variables of gdpminder in continents.

```{r,fig.height=5, fig.width=10}





p1 <- grp_gap_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_life)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("life expectancy") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))

p2 <- grp_gap_data %>% ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
           geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_popu)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("Population") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))

p3 <- grp_gap_data %>% ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
           geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_income)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("Income") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))


p4 <- grp_gap_data %>% ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
           geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_child_mortality)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("Child mortality") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))

p5 <- grp_gap_data %>% ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
           geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_CO2)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("CO2 emission") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))

p6 <- grp_gap_data %>% ggplot(aes(color=continent, group=continent)) + 
           geom_point(aes(x=year, y=ave_baby)) +
    xlab("Continent") + ylab("Baby per women") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=(c(1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)),
                              labels=c("1960","1970","1980","1990","2000","2010","2020"))



(p1 + p2)/(p3 + p4)/(p5 + p6)


```

From the plot we made previously, we can find the relationship between gapminder data and year.

1. In general, With improving science and technology, social welfare is accompanied by time, the trend of average life expectancy, average population, and average income increase for all continents. However, the slopes of each continent are unlikely to be the same based on specific historical, economical, and social situations. 

2. European countries have long been leaders in this area due to their better technology and social welfare. It is worth mentioning that until the 1990s, life expectancy in African countries maintained a very high growth rate, but between 1990 and 1995 there was a significant decline in life expectancy, which can be explained by the fact that African societies experienced a large degree of change during this period, such as military coups or wars, but fortunately, it has been maintained since then. Fortunately, the growth rate has remained high since then, but it still lags behind other continents.

3. In terms of population, with the exception of Asia, the world population is not growing very much, and even in Europe, the population curve is almost horizontal. It is well known that Asia has two populous countries, China and India, whose combined population is almost a third of the world. Since the 1970s, the total population of Asia has maintained a high level of growth and I will further explore what are the factors that influence the population.

4. One interesting point on the income side is that there was a very significant fluctuation in income around the world in 2008, and one possible reason for this could be the Financial crisis of 2007-2008, which affected almost the entire world and caused a large degree of recession, and was particularly pronounced in Europe America and Asia.

5. In contrast, average child mortality and average fertility are accompanied by time. Compared to average child mortality, average fertility may be hard to understand, so I will research this part in the next part. 

6. In terms of child mortality, with the improvement of medical technology, most of the continent can maintain a very low level now, but Africa still has a gap with other continents in the world even now because of the high child mortality rate in the beginning.

7. Average CO2 emission is the very unique case there, it is relatively not easy to identify the relationship between CO2 emission and time by continent in whole parts. However, as we know, most western countries started to realize the importance of protecting the environment in the 1990s, and the decrease in CO2 emission was very obvious. In addition, there are many developing countries in Asia and the Americas, that would require more natural resources to develop their economy with the cost of pollution, so for the rest of the world, the CO2 emission was increasing with time. 


# Relationship between variables

## General situation for each continent in 2010

Choosing 2010 as an example.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}

#Study1
Study1_data <- as_tibble(Study1)
Study11_data <- Study1_data %>% mutate(population=population/1e6)
Study1_data_2010 <-  Study11_data %>% filter(year == 2010)
```

There is a table about the social, economic, and health characteristics of countries on five continents.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#gapData2010


table1::label(Study1_data_2010$life_expectancy) <- "Life Expectancy"
table1::label(Study1_data_2010$population) <- "population"
table1::label(Study1_data_2010$income) <- "income"
table1::label(Study1_data_2010$child_mortality) <- "child_mortality"
table1::label(Study1_data_2010$CO2) <- "CO2"
table1::label(Study1_data_2010$baby) <- "baby"


table1::units(Study1_data_2010$life_expectancy) <- "years"
table1::units(Study1_data_2010$population) <- "million"
table1::units(Study1_data_2010$income) <- "$"
#table1::units(Study1_data_2010$child_mortality) <- ""
table1::units(Study1_data_2010$CO2) <- "tonnes per person"
#table1::units(Study1_data_2010$baby) <- "total fertility"

  
table1::table1(~life_expectancy + population  + income + child_mortality + CO2 + baby | continent, 
               data = Study1_data_2010, overall=FALSE, caption="Social, economic and health characterics of countries in five continents.")





```

I will visualize this table by box plot to explore the distribution of gdpminder values in every continent.

There are box plots for gdpminder by continent sort by means in 2010. 

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=10}


p1 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, life_expectancy, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = life_expectancy, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("life expectancy") +
  geom_boxplot()

p2 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, population, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = population, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Population") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans="log10")

p3 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, income, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = income, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Income") +
  geom_boxplot()

p4 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, child_mortality, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = child_mortality, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Child mortality") +
  geom_boxplot()

p5 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, CO2, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = CO2, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("CO2 emission") +
  geom_boxplot()

p6 = Study1_data_2010 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(continent, baby, 
                            FUN = median, na.rm=T), y = baby, fill = continent)) +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Baby per women") +
  geom_boxplot()



(p1 + p2)/(p3 + p4)/(p5 + p6)


```

Similar results, I got from the previous relationship between gapminder data and year. Europe maintains a very high the vast majority of level of gdpminder values. 

1. In the income boxplot, the distance between the lower quartile and upper quartile is obviously wider than other continents, but the mean of income still keeps the highest level. This indicates that Among Asia countries, the income gap between countries is very large.

2. In the baby per women boxplot, there are two outstanding outliers points which imply the two most populous countries in the world China and India. 

3. The data for 2010 is not very optimistic in Africa, it has the highest child mortality and baby per woman with the lowest life expectancy. What is worse is that the gap between the maximum and minimum values is very obvious from these box plots, so the box is relatively much wider in these data. The socioeconomic degree between countries in African countries is very large.


## Correctional coeffection between gdpminders values

According to 2010, this table presents the correlation coefficient between every two variables. 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
ggpairs(Study1_data_2010%>%mutate(population=log10(population)+6,income=log10(income)), columns = c(3:8))
#ggpairs(Study1_data_2010, columns = c(3:8), ggplot2::aes(colour = continent))

```

I create a table to show the positive correlation and negative correlation variables for each gdpminder value.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}

Study1_data_2010Corr <- Study1_data_2010%>%mutate(population=log10(population)+6,income=log10(income))%>%select(life_expectancy:baby)

colnames(Study1_data_2010Corr) <- c('life expectancy','population','income','child mortality','CO2','baby')

corr <- cor(Study1_data_2010Corr, use="pairwise.complete.obs")
p.mat <- cor_pmat(Study1_data_2010Corr)

p7 = ggcorrplot(corr, hc.order = TRUE,
    type = "lower", p.mat = p.mat)
p7
```

From those plots, we can get easily get that Life expectancy has positive correlations with income and CO2 emission and negative correlations with child mortality and Babies per woman. Income has positive correlations with life expectancy and CO2 emission and negative correlations with child mortality and Babies per woman. Child mortality has positive correlations with income and Babies per woman and negative correlations with life expectancy and CO2 emission. CO2 emission has positive correlations with life expectancy and income and negative correlations with life expectancy and CO2 emission. In addition, for the variable population, there are no direct relations with the rest of the variables and populations which is very strange. 

## Babies per woman vs variable(weight=population)

I select Babies per woman as an example to find the relationship between babies per woman and variable, also, I should consider the population of countries there. It is because, Countries with larger populations have more babies per woman, which is unfair. During the calculation, I should weight = population. 

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, message=FALSE}

p1 <- Study1_data %>% 
    group_by(year, continent) %>%
    summarize(
      ave_life_expectancy = weighted.mean(life_expectancy, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_baby = weighted.mean(baby, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ave_life_expectancy, y=ave_baby))+
      geom_line(aes(color=continent, group=continent), size=1) + xlab("life expectancy") + ylab("Baby per women") +
      theme_bw()


p2 <- Study1_data %>% 
    group_by(year, continent) %>%
    summarize(
      ave_child_mortality = weighted.mean(child_mortality, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_baby = weighted.mean(baby, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ave_child_mortality, y=ave_baby))+
      geom_line(aes(color=continent, group=continent), size=1) + xlab("child mortality") + ylab("Baby per women") +
      theme_bw()


p3 <- Study1_data %>% 
    group_by(year, continent) %>%
    summarize(
      ave_income = weighted.mean(income, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE),
      ave_baby = weighted.mean(baby, w = as.numeric(population), na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ave_income, y=ave_baby))+
      geom_line(aes(color=continent, group=continent), size=1) + xlab("Income") + ylab("Baby per women") +
      theme_bw()

p1/p2/p3

From the plots, we can find that the relationship between life expectancy and Baby per woman is when life expectancy increases, then Baby per woman decreases over time. European countries maintain very outstanding results, having the highest life expectancy and the lowest fertility levels. However, there is an upward trend in fertility levels from almost median point in this line but it is still not very pronounced and it is necessary to combine other variables to better explain this phenomenon.

In the linear relationship between child mortality and fertility, in general as child mortality rises fertility rates also rise, to varying degrees on each continent. One possible explanation for the lack of fertility growth in Africa at around 200 child mortality is that at this time society is under load and at the limit of its capacity to bear more births at high child mortality.

In the linear relationship between income and fertility, in the long run, when economic growth is relatively stable and income expectations are relatively flat, approaching the premise that technology levels remain constant fertility is characterized by diminishing marginal utility the economy grows, income increases, and fertility declines.As long as the skill level remains stable, the marginal utility of fertility decreases for both high- and low-income households as the economy grows steadily.



# Conclusion & Discussion

The number of countries is increasing with the development of the times, especially before the 21st century. For some relatively new countries, general information is missing for historical reasons. European countries have long been leaders in the field due to their better technology and social welfare. In general, as science and technology have improved, so has social welfare over time, with average life expectancy, average population and average income trending upwards across all continents. In contrast, average child mortality and average fertility rates have varied over time. We can easily obtain that life expectancy is positively correlated with income and CO2 emissions, and negatively correlated with child mortality and infants per woman. Income is positively correlated with life expectancy and CO2 emissions, and negatively correlated with child mortality and infants per woman. Child mortality is positively correlated with income and infants per woman, and negatively correlated with life expectancy and CO Carbon dioxide emissions are positively correlated with life expectancy and income and negatively correlated with life expectancy and carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, it is very strange that for the variable population, there is no direct relationship with other variables and population. When life expectancy increases, babies per woman decreases over time.As long as the skill level remains stable, the marginal utility of fertility decreases for both high- and low-income households as the economy grows steadily.

The ‘cycle of poverty’ is a model that represents a series of events that essentially holds a population in poverty.  This research crudely illustrates the cycle of poverty where high fertility, low economic growth, poor health and other developmental issues are inter-related.  Breaking out of the cycle is extremely difficult to do.
